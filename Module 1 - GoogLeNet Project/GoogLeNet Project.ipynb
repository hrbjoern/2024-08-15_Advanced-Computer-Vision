    "\n",
    "GoogLeNet was created to solve the overfitting problem of big architectures. This was achieved by using Inception modules (layers) instead of the regular ones. Besides this _trick_, the authors have added two **mini-networks** in the middle of the model. These mini-networks are called Auxiliary classifiers.\n",

    "### Auxiliary classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Auxiliary classifiers are small networks used ONLY in the TRAINING time to prevent vanishing gradient problems for more extensive networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These small networks have the same output layer as the primary (big) model, with the Softmax/Sigmoid function. Calculating loss from these points helps preserver gradients in lower layers in the model and update the training time better.\n",

    "Note: The number of outputs depends on the number of classes. Our task here is cats vs. dogs. Since this is the binary classification, we will use Sigmoid instead of Softmax with only 1 (one) neuron as the output.\n",
